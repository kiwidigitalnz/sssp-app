  - `ScopeOfWork.tsx`
- **Design Decisions**:
  - Used step-by-step approach for better user experience
  - Implemented form persistence to prevent data loss
  - Added validation using Zod for type safety

### 2. Training Requirements
- **Implementation**: Dynamic training management system
- **Key Components**:
  - `TrainingRequirements.tsx`
  - `AddTrainingDialog.tsx`
  - `RequiredTrainingSection.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Add/Edit/Delete training requirements
  - Template selection from previous trainings
  - Real-time validation and feedback
- **Recent Improvements**:
  - Added edit functionality for existing training items
  - Improved button alignment and consistency
  - Enhanced user feedback with toast notifications

### 3. Emergency Procedures
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive emergency response management
- **Key Components**: 
  - `EmergencyProcedures.tsx`
  - `EmergencyContactSelection.tsx`
  - `EmergencyResponsePlan.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Emergency contact management
  - Assembly points configuration
  - Incident reporting workflow

### 4. Hazard Management
- **Implementation**: Risk assessment and hazard tracking
- **Key Components**:
  - `HazardManagement.tsx`
  - `HazardTable.tsx`
  - `RiskLevelGuide.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic hazard assessment
  - Risk level calculation
  - Mitigation strategies

## Technical Architecture

### Database Structure
- PostgreSQL with Supabase
- Key Tables:
  - `sssps`: Main SSSP records
  - `sssp_activity`: Audit trail
  - `template_versions`: Template versioning

### State Management
- React Query for server state
- Local state with React hooks
- Form state persistence using custom hooks

### UI Components
- Built on shadcn/ui
- Consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
- Responsive design throughout

## Pending Improvements

### High Priority
1. [ ] Implement batch operations for training requirements
2. [ ] Add PDF export functionality
3. [ ] Enhance form validation feedback

### Medium Priority
1. [ ] Add search functionality for training templates
2. [ ] Implement advanced filtering for hazards
3. [ ] Add bulk import/export features

### Low Priority
1. [ ] Add dark mode support
2. [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts
3. [ ] Add more customization options for reports

## Known Issues
1. Button alignment inconsistencies in some forms
2. Performance optimization needed for large datasets
3. Mobile responsiveness improvements needed in some sections

## Best Practices
1. **Code Organization**
   - Components are organized by feature
   - Shared utilities in separate files
   - Type definitions in dedicated .d.ts files

2. **State Management**
   - Server state handled by React Query
   - Local state with React hooks
   - Form state persistence for better UX

3. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error boundaries
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Proper error logging

4. **Performance**
   - Lazy loading for large components
   - Memoization where appropriate
   - Optimized database queries

## Development Guidelines
1. **Code Style**
   - Use TypeScript for type safety
   - Follow React best practices
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions

2. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for utilities
   - Component testing with React Testing Library
   - End-to-end testing with Cypress

3. **Documentation**
   - Document all major components
   - Keep README updated
   - Include code comments for complex logic

## Deployment
- Deployed via Lovable platform
- Automatic builds and deployments
- Environment-specific configurations

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Next 2 Weeks)
- [ ] Complete remaining form validations
- [ ] Implement PDF export
- [ ] Add bulk operations

### Phase 2 (1-2 Months)
- [ ] Enhanced reporting features
- [ ] Advanced search capabilities
- [ ] Template management system

### Phase 3 (3+ Months)
- [ ] Integration with external systems
- [ ] Advanced analytics
- [ ] Mobile app development
